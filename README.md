# cheap-smart-glasses

this idea is pretty basic. I want a microphone on my face that I can use to record my verbal prompting all day long. I want the recorded MP3 to automatically upload to some cloud every time I cross paths with a Starbucks or free Wi-Fi. I want everything to be voice controlled.

I don't currently want it to do anything with ar.


the main point is to have a vocal prompter that records MP3 automatically.

it's basically a cross between the AI pendant and the rabbit OS. and the reason I wanted to be on sunglasses, is that it's the best place to put a microphone on my face.

ultimately, the design is meant to be able to prompt all day, and then allow the uploaded MP3 to cause all of the cloud API and python programs to be activated from all of the commands that I have recorded while out on a walk.

secondarily, and also importantly, no smartphone is required for talking or transferring files, although that could be a possibility. the purpose is to have a new device that out modes the smartphone typically. and basically it's like a very very cheap version of meta Ray-Bans, except the camera could be added at a later time, and it does not require a smartphone in order to send the mp3 to the cloud.

I will send off some basic schema and more elaboration at a later time, I hope. and there are definitely more advanced iterations of the product, but this is the most basic function that I seriously hope to achieve. and I have a small budget available to pay the electrician to build the microprocessor and computer chip and power source and Wi-Fi or possibly Bluetooth transmitter into the cheap sunglasses, or make a small thing that will be able to sit on the side of some sunglasses, interchangeable.

# Cheap Smart Glasses Concept Analysis

## Core Features
- **Always-on microphone** for continuous voice recording
- **MP3 recording** of verbal prompts throughout the day
- **Automatic cloud uploads** when WiFi is available (Starbucks, etc.)
- **Voice-controlled operation** (no buttons/touch needed)
- **Smartphone-independent** operation (though smartphone pairing optional)

## Technical Implementation Considerations

### Hardware Components Needed:
1. **Microcontroller** (e.g., ESP32 - has WiFi/BT, low power modes)
2. **Quality MEMS microphone** (omnidirectional, noise-reducing)
3. **Storage** (microSD card for temporary MP3 storage)
4. **Power** (small LiPo battery with USB-C charging)
5. **WiFi/BLE module** (for connectivity)
6. **Physical design** (could be clip-on module for existing glasses)

### Software Requirements:
1. **Voice activity detection** (to save storage when not speaking)
2. **MP3 encoding** (real-time audio compression)
3. **WiFi scanning/connection** (auto-connect to known networks)
4. **Cloud sync protocol** (could use MQTT, HTTP POST, or Dropbox API)
5. **Voice command recognition** (basic local processing for start/stop)

## Development Approach

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept
1. Prototype with ESP32 + microphone + battery on breadboard
2. Implement basic recording to SD card
3. Add WiFi auto-connect and file upload

### Phase 2: Miniaturization
1. Design custom PCB combining all components
2. 3D print enclosure that attaches to glasses
3. Optimize power consumption for all-day use

### Phase 3: Cloud Integration
1. Set up cloud service to receive/process audio
2. Implement API triggering from audio commands
3. Add transcription/command processing

## Budget Considerations
Basic prototype could be built for under $50 in components. Mass production could potentially bring unit cost below $100.

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of this concept? I can provide more technical details about component selection, power optimization strategies, or cloud integration approaches.
