# cheap-smart-glasses

this idea is pretty basic. I want a microphone on my face that I can use to record my verbal prompting all day long. I want the recorded MP3 to automatically upload to some cloud every time I cross paths with a Starbucks or free Wi-Fi. I want everything to be voice controlled.

I don't currently want it to do anything with ar.


the main point is to have a vocal prompter that records MP3 automatically.

it's basically a cross between the AI pendant and the rabbit OS. and the reason I wanted to be on sunglasses, is that it's the best place to put a microphone on my face.

ultimately, the design is meant to be able to prompt all day, and then allow the uploaded MP3 to cause all of the cloud API and python programs to be activated from all of the commands that I have recorded while out on a walk.

secondarily, and also importantly, no smartphone is required for talking or transferring files, although that could be a possibility. the purpose is to have a new device that out modes the smartphone typically. and basically it's like a very very cheap version of meta Ray-Bans, except the camera could be added at a later time, and it does not require a smartphone in order to send the mp3 to the cloud.

I will send off some basic schema and more elaboration at a later time, I hope. and there are definitely more advanced iterations of the product, but this is the most basic function that I seriously hope to achieve. and I have a small budget available to pay the electrician to build the microprocessor and computer chip and power source and Wi-Fi or possibly Bluetooth transmitter into the cheap sunglasses, or make a small thing that will be able to sit on the side of some sunglasses, interchangeable.
